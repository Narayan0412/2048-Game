        <h1>2048 Game Rules</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The goal of 2048 is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a High Score.</p>
        
        <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game is played on a 4x4 grid.</li>
            <li>At the start, two tiles are randomly placed on the grid, each with a value of either 2 or 4.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Move Tiles:</strong> You can slide all the tiles on the grid up, down, left, or right.
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard for desktop play.</li>
                    <li>Swipe gestures are used for mobile play.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Combine Tiles:</strong> When two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers of the two original tiles (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, and so on).</li>
            <li><strong>Spawn New Tiles:</strong> After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 randomly appears on an empty spot on the grid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <p>Try to beat the High Score.</p>

        <h2>Game Over</h2>
        <p>The game is over when there are no empty spots on the grid and no possible moves left to combine tiles.</p>

        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Partial Moves:</strong> All tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they either hit the edge of the grid or another tile.</li>
            <li><strong>No Backtracking:</strong> Once you make a move, you cannot undo it.</li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> The score is the sum of the values of the tiles combined during the moves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Think about the consequences of each move and try to avoid moves that will leave you with few options.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Your High-Value Tiles Together:</strong> Try to keep your higher-value tiles in one corner to make it easier to combine them.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Filling the Grid:</strong> Always keep at least one empty spot on the grid to ensure you have space for new tiles to spawn.</li>
        </ul>
